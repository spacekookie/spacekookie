### Hi there 👋 I'm Kookie

I'm an independent software researcher living in Berlin. 
I have a [sponsors] page, if you want to learn more about the work I do.
My pronouns are ✨ **they/them** ✨!

---

**None of my projects are hosted on GitHub!** I believe that the internet should be a decentralised network, 
and that companies have far too much power over our lives.
GitHub is no exception to this and while I have an account to participate in other people's projects (NixOS, and Rust for example),
I don't want to encourage people to use it by hosting my own projects here.
