### Hi there 👋 I'm Kookie

I'm an independent software researcher living in Berlin. 
I have a [sponsors] page, if you want to learn more about the open source work I do, and how you can tip me!
My pronouns are ✨ **she/they** ✨!

**I don't want to use GitHub!**  I believe that the internet should be a decentralised network,
and that companies have far too much power over our lives.
Github is no exception to this, and while I do have this account to participate in other people's projects,
I try to minimise the number of projects I myself maintain on here.

Unfortunately GitHub is a social necessity for those of us who produce code,
reminiscent of the role of Facebook in the early 2010's for social engagements.

Instead of GitHub, I try to distribute my work across a number of different forges.
Additionally I try to evaluate new forges from time to time as well, to potentially discover a nice community of developers, or a better workflow.
I think we should all strive to get off code-facebook.  I know this is hard, and the companies we work for make it even harder.
But that's not a reason not to try.

In that spirit, I have code on the following forges:

- 📚 https://codeberg.org/kookie — general purpose collective forge, which I use for most of my public projects currently
- 🍵 https://cyberchaos.dev/kookie — CCC-adjacent forge where I keep my private infrastructure and Work-in-progress experiments
